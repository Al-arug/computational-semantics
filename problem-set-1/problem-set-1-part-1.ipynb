Then, arrange with your fellow group members to meet online in the Zoom classroom and consolidate solutions in a separate group notebook that you will then submit together. You may also want to use a discussion forum and other tools that are created for your group on Canvas to communicate with each other. Use Github to commit your individual proposed solutions within the group and also for the final submittion to the teachers.\n",

    "If you get stuck (both individually or a group), write your questions to the general Canvas discussion topic for Lab 1 rather than sending us individual emails. This is to ensure that if we provide additional information about the assignments, the information will be available for everyone. If you know the answer, please feel free to answer but don't provide a direct solution. \n",
